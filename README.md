# CS 423 Project-1
Team: Alex Johnson and Chris Wu

# Instructions
All of the code for this project was written in matlab and is present in this repository.
To generate all plots and results, run the function ```matlab run_all_plots.m```. All figures will be generated in the output/ directory. Note that the bifurcation plots are set to run with a reduced quality so that they are run in a reasonable time. Some post processing was done with the initial conditions and bifurcation plots so not all figures are generated with the code (e.g. the zoomed in bifurcation plot). Note that default_plot offers a better export if export_fig is available (See default_plot.m).
